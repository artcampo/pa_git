bug1
Input instruction for fetch was loaded asynchronously.

bug2
Registers were one cycle ahead of control words. Due to regf loading them asynchronously.

bug 3
Memory gate delayed by one cycle. Memg was synchronous, when it shouldn't.

Bug 4
Memory write done at the beginning of MA stage.
Thus write should be done only on clock edge.

Bug 5
Decode ctrl word loaded at the same time as PC. Clock and reset added to it.
